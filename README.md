## Why I made this API
I am a huge fan of the warriors and wanted to make a way to see some information about the team using a CLI. This API will be used in that CLI to collect the information so that I can use it in the CLI. 
## How it works
I scrap up html elements from the official nba website using goquery. 
## Notes
If you have another team you want to customize this API for, you can simply change the url to the respective page. Though, it is possible that it will not line up perfectly so just keep note of the actual html elements on the page.
